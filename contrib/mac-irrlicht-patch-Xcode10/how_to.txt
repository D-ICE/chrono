Xcode 10 brought a new issue on Irrlicht. The problem could be identified, here is the 
solution:

unpack irrlicht-1.8.4.zip to a directory of your choice
copy the patch file irrlicht-xcode10.diff into the irrlicht-1.8.4 directory
from the terminal type:

cd /your/Path/irrlicht-1.8.4
patch -p1 < irrlicht-xcode10.diff
cd source/Irrlicht/MacOSX
xcodebuild -target libIrrlicht.a -configuration Release build
cp build/Release/libIrrlicht.a ../../../lib/MacOSX

This is proven to work on MacOS 10.13 (High Sierra).
On MacOS 10.14 (Mojave) you can also build Irrlicht with these changes, but Apple messed up
the OpenGL library and you will get only an empty window without 3D graphics.

The same problem exists for GLFW 3.2.1.
